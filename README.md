Scehduling Project Algorithm

## Description
The purpose of this utility is to help and support the IT student and enthusiast dealing with Operating Systems.
The idea is to implement an application that simulates the management of process scheduling in a multiprogrammed system with non-preemptive algorithms (such as First-Come First-Served, Shortest Job First) and that calculates the Turnaround values and the average waiting time, all considering the context switch.
